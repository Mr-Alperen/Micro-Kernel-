# MicroKernel++ Community Policy

## Purpose

The **MicroKernel++ Project** is an open-source, community-driven initiative. Its purpose is to provide a minimal, modular, and research-oriented kernel platform for educational, experimental, and development purposes. This policy outlines the principles and expectations for all contributors and participants in the MicroKernel++ community.

## Community Principles

1. **Openness**  
   MicroKernel++ is publicly accessible. Anyone interested in kernel development, operating systems research, or low-level systems programming is welcome to view, use, and contribute to the project.

2. **Collaboration**  
   Contributions from individuals or teams of all skill levels are encouraged. Respectful discussion, peer review, and constructive feedback are expected in all community interactions.

3. **Transparency**  
   All development activities, including commits, pull requests, and issue tracking, should be performed in a transparent manner to foster trust and collective progress.

4. **Respect and Professionalism**  
   The community maintains a positive and inclusive environment. Harassment, discriminatory language, or any form of disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.

5. **Attribution and Licensing**  
   Contributors must respect existing licenses and provide appropriate attribution for any third-party resources used in the project. Contributions are considered to be under the same project license unless otherwise specified.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Code Contributions:** Use clean, well-documented code. Follow the project’s coding style and include clear commit messages.  
- **Documentation:** Contributions to documentation, tutorials, and examples are highly encouraged to help the community grow.  
- **Bug Reports & Feature Requests:** Submit detailed, reproducible reports. Participate in discussions constructively.

## Governance

MicroKernel++ is overseen by **Stux6 Tech**, which coordinates releases, reviews contributions, and ensures the project maintains its technical and educational goals. While community input is highly valued, final decisions regarding project direction rest with the core maintainers.

## Disclaimer

MicroKernel++ is a research and experimental kernel. It is provided "as-is" for educational and development purposes. Users and contributors acknowledge that they are responsible for understanding and safely running the kernel in controlled environments.

This policy ensures that **MicroKernel++ remains open, collaborative, and inclusive**, providing a safe and productive environment for all participants.
